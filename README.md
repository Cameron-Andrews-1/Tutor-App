# Tutor-App
Developed a CRUD application using Oracle APEX to facilitate the matching of tutors to students based on their desired characteristics. I used SQL to create my own database schema, form a custom user authentication process, and create/update/delete rows. PL/SQL was used to handle requests to a RESTful API called numVerify. Lastly, there was some Javascript development for UI customization.
